    "# Video Signal Compression\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Mikołaj Leszczuk, Andres Vejar\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 1. Purpose\n",
    "The aim of this applied experiment is to practice video sequence compression standards. In particular, it is required to analyze the impact of the compression ratio (CR) [1] on video image quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment requires a basic knowledge of the compression methods used in the MPEG standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Experiment Description\n",
    "The experiment description is presented as a processing pipeline in the block diagram below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"img/diag.svg\"  width=\"500\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram, a video sequence $s$ (left) is the source data for the experiment. It represents the *original* video and it will be used as a reference to compare it with compressed versions of the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this source $s$, the first operation block $R$ correspond to the creation of a reconstructed (compressed) video sequence $r$, from $s$. Every compression algorithm require to specify a set of parameters that will affect the results of conversion (e.g. speed, video quality, file size). In the block diagram, the compression parameters are designated as $\\theta$, and the compression operation can be defined by $R(\\theta,s) = r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a pair of source and reconstructed videos, it is possible to compare them, a base calculation can be the observed compression ratio $c$, with $C(s,r) = c$. If the two basic video sequences have the same data rate (e.g. frames per second), this compression ratio can be estimated as the filesize ratio, $c = \\displaystyle \\frac{\\text{SIZE}(s)}{\\text{SIZE}(r)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare the compression ratio with respect to the image quality, objective metrics for distortion are used, that consider the variations pixel by pixel between the video sequences $s$ and $r$, with $D(s,r) = d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To consider subjective measures of quality, a human observer needs to decide which value of quality to set for the reconstructed (compressed) video sequence $r$. This scoring decision is represented by the block $\\text{MOS}$, where $\\text{MOS}(r) = m$. Using the absolute category ranking, there are 5 posible outputs values mapped as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 5 :\tExcellent\n",
    "* 4 :\tGood\n",
    "* 3 :\tFair\n",
    "* 2 :\tPoor\n",
    "* 1 :\tBad \n",
    "\n",
    "The output values $(c,d,m)$ can be used to analyze the impact of the compression ratio on video image quality, that can be done empirically using a collection of data points:\n",
    "$(c_0,d_0,m_0), (c_1,d_1, m_1), \\ldots$ to generate a scatter plot of $d$ versus $c$ and $m$ versus $c$. \n",
    "The expected result is that in general, the distortion value will grow with higher compression ratios and that the MOS will fall with higher compression ratios. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Tasks\n",
    "Determine the dependence of the degree of distortion $d$ with respect to the CR for a few selected source video sequences and several CRs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For distortion, calculate **objective distortion metrics** (averaged on the frames) for the selected source video sequences. Some distortion metrics are available in the application <a href='#vidcomp'>Video Compare</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "* As a **subjective quality measure** calculate the *mean opinion scores* (MOS) [2], the user assessment at the time of viewing the reconstructed video sequence using the absolute category ranking.\n",
    " \n",
    "* Determine the number of measurement points to reliably cover the whole range of MOS and fit in a meaningful flow rate limit. \n",
    "\n",
    "* After an objective and subjective evaluation of **the reconstructed (processed) video sequences**, apply the assessment chart (MOS as a function of CR or as a function of bit rate), with a number of measurements that allows to reliably plotting the graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In addition to the aggregate charts, for these sequences, designate two additional characteristics. One for codecs with INTRA + INTER frames compression. The second for the coding that uses only INTRA frames compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compare the CR obtained in video standards with the ZIP CR (to allow comparison of the graph). Is the ZIP compression of data from a codec video compressed file increasing its CR?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The acquisition of the experiment data can be done using the following loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open an **uncompressed video sequence** . Uncompressed video sequences are available as “Uncompressed AVI” and possibly as YUV (for processing into AVI containers).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enabling** compression with a choice of AVI or MPEG-4 format, codec and CR.\n",
    "   – as far as time permits, you should repeat the test for different CR.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Saving** with several file CRs (with different names) – note that not necessarily the resulting video sequence is compressed with a given CR.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Subjective** (visual) quality score (MOS) of the moving image.\n",
    "5. **Objective** (computer-aimed, quantitative) assessment (according to specified distortion metrics) of the quality of the moving image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop should be repeated for different video sequences, until the end of the time available for the experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to plan in advance the number of measurements required to fulfil the tasks during the time reserved for the execution of the experiment. At least one codec needs to be analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Objective metrics for distortion\n",
    "If we consider two grayscale images of $N\\times{M}$ pixels, the source image $s$ and a reconstructed image $r$ from $s$, (e.g. $r = R(s)$), the following objective metrics can be defined:\n",
    "* Absolute error (AE): $$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "The variable $\\text{MAX}_\\text{I}$ represents the maximum value of a pixel, for 8-bit images \n",
    "$\\text{MAX}_\\text{I}=255$.\n",

    "## 5. Codecs and Reference Video Sources\n",
    "### 5.1 Codecs\n",
    "\n",
    "During the experiment, first test the following video codecs:\n",
    "* MPEG-4 (with H.264 extensions, also known as AVC – Advanced Video Coding, MPEG-4 part 10) \n",
    "If time permits, also test (although there are some problems with some of them):\n",
    "* Motion JPEG (MJPEG) – only INTRA frames compression coding. \n",
    "* Huffman YUV (HYUV, HuffYUV) – only INTRA frames compression coding.\n",
    "* MPEG-1 \n",
    "* MPEG-2 \n",
    "* MPEG-4 (without H.264 extensions, in any implementation, can be DivX or XviD)\n",
    "* H.261\n",
    "* H.263/H.263\n",
    "* H.265, also known as HEVC – High Efficiency Video Coding\n",
    "* Windows Media Video (WMV)\n",
    "* Theora \n",
    "* Dirac\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless otherwise stated, codecs support INTRA + INTER intercoding modes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Reference Video Sources\n",
    "*Exemplary, non-compressed / pristine quality (Uncompressed / Reference AVI) video sequences can be downloaded, for example, from these addresses:*\n",
    "* ftp://vqeg.its.bldrdoc.gov/MM/ (SD),\n",
    "* ftp://vqeg.its.bldrdoc.gov/SDTV/ (SD),\n",
    "* ftp://vqeg.its.bldrdoc.gov/HDTV/NTIA_source/ (HD),\n",

    "* http://live.ece.utexas.edu/ (HD),\n",
    "* http://trecvid.nist.gov/ (HD),\n",
    "* https://qoe.agh.edu.pl (HD).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Operating systems may incorrectly indicate that these files are still compressed with “MS H.263” codec – but this is not true. Since some files were prepared for NTSC (30 half-frames per second) and are played in PAL (25 half-frames per second), the playback speed may seem subjectively too low.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Technical Notes\n",
    "This section contains information on the technical feasibility of the experiment (i.e., primarily used programs). Special software is required only for customized compression and objective comparison. **To play back the sequence, a built-in player is sufficient**. Simple compression and distortion estimation functionality is provided by the application <a href='#vidcomp'>Video Compare</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Compression\n",
    "A simple compression interface is available in the application  <a href='#vidcomp'>Video Compare</a>, in the Tab *Transcode*. The transcoding and compression is provided using a very fast execution mode, in order to allow the practical use for online comparison of videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "More customized compression can be achieved by the use of two software packages:\n",
    "* **VLC media player**, using Convert/Stream then Choose Profile then Custom then Customize. \n",
    "    To take a video file and change it to a different format or bitrate, you will need to  follow the process of transcoding, which is described here: https://wiki.videolan.org/transcode/.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* **HandBrake**, using Open Source then Preset then Save As then Start. (downloadable from: https://handbrake.fr/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, VirtualDub (using Save as AVI...) along with the ffdshow and x264vfw codecs can be used, with the caution that the software is not up-to-date and works only on Windows OS. To enable the window on the settings of compression parameters in VirtualDub, follows: Video/Compression.../ffdshow…|x264vfw…/Configure.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Compression can be made by different settings of the desired stream bit rate. It should be noted that the rate requested is for information purposes only – actual, achieved rate **may vary significantly** from the rate desired, especially for very small and very large bitrates – which is due to the limitations of codecs. The operating system may give the wrong information on the bitrate of compressed streams, it is better if this information is confronted with the size of the file and **calculated by yourself** considering the file size, resolution, color space, duration of sequence and FPS Ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Determination of Distortion\n",
    "To determine the objective degree of distortion, the application <a href='#vidcomp'>Video Compare</a> can be used. The application requires two files that contain the original and reconstructed frame video sequence. It can also performs a basic transcode and compression, in this case it requires only the source file.  In addition, the application visualizes the differences between the original and the reconstructed sequence, and it provides the compression ratio and MAE and PSNR as distortion metrics.\n",
